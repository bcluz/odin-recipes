Odin HTML project
This is a mock recipe website I am building as part of The Odin Project curriculum. 
Once this project is completed I will have learned how to build a basic HTML website, add links and images, and format text. As I continue in my coursework I hope to add CSS styling and Javascript programming onto the mock website.
