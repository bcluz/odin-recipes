        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A simple, classic salad recipe</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large or 2 small heads of romaine lettuce</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese, shredded or shaved</li>
            <li>Crisp croutons. The recipe below makes enough for 2 salads.</li>
            <li>Caesar salad dressing. Homemade is best</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Making Homemade Croutons</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350˚F. Cut the baguette in half lengthwise through the top of the baguette then slice diagonally into 1/4" thick pieces. Place the breads onto a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine 3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil and 1 tsp of finely minced garlic. Drizzle the garlic oil over the croutons and sprinkle the top with 2 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Toss until evenly coated. Spread in a single layer over the baking sheet and bake at 350˚F until light golden and crisp (10-12 minutes), or to desired crispness.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Making Caesar Dressing</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together garlic, dijon, Worcestershire, lemon juice and red wine vinegar.</li>
            <li>Slowly drizzle in extra virgin olive oil while whisking constantly.</li>
            <li>Season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper, or to taste.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Making Caesar Salad</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse, dry and chop or tear the romaine into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Place in a large serving bowl and sprinkle generously with shredded parmesan cheese and cooled croutons.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with caesar dressing and toss gently until lettuce is evenly coated.</li>
        </ol>
